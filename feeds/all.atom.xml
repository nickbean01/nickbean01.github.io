&lt;p&gt;I'm often away from home, but this time is a bit different. As the pandemic job hunt continues I've taken off from New Jersey to spend some time with my parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dad and Nancy are located in Burnt Hills, NY. Their property butts up against a wetland forest that can't be developed. It's an easy to get to private getaway. Spent most of my time there cycling, hiking, job searching, writing some music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dad and I have both taken up an interest in mushrooms in recent years. Autumn in the Northeast is the perfect time to hunt for mushrooms. We had Lion's Mane for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="mybox" href="/img/lee_mush.jpg" title="Title that is displayed on mouse-over and as caption in colorbox"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lee investigating a mushroom" src="/img/lee_mush.jpg" width="300px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="mybox" href="/img/fresh_mane.jpg" title="Title that is displayed on mouse-over and as caption in colorbox"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lion's Mane" src="/img/fresh_mane.jpg" width="300px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="mybox" href="/img/cooked_mane.jpg" title="Title that is displayed on mouse-over and as caption in colorbox"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cooking Lion's Mane" src="/img/cooked_mane.jpg" width="300px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before heading to Williston, VT to stay with my mom for a couple weeks, Jeremy and Hannah made a quick jaunt up to the Green Mountain National Forest to join me for a weekend of camping and hiking. This National Forest is the only place in the east I've found that offers free primitive camping similar to what you find out west.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mountain weather was sporadic. The first day was quite calm. As the sun set the winds blew in and didn't dissipate until around 3am the second night. The change from dead quiet to loud winds knocking the trees together every couple minutes made it difficult to sleep. Minute long sheets of rain the second night didn't help either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday we rose early and headed to Bolton, VT for an overnight hike on the Long Trail, a notoriously difficult and wet trail that we still managed to underestimate. Temperatures dipped down to the low 20s (F) that night. During the hike back down on Indigenous Peoples' Day we took a dip in the frigid Gleason Creek, which feeds into the Winooski River.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes when I can't get back to sleep I get on the bike and mash the pedals over to the waterfront. No better time to have free reign over the streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check back for more.&lt;/p&gt;
